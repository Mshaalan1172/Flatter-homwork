//What will be the output of this code snippet? Explain your answer: ```dart void
//main() { int x = 5; int y = x + 2 * 3; print(y); } ```

// the output will be 11, x=5 and y=5+6 (multiplication and division has beed done before addition)
void main() {
  int x = 5;
  int y = x + 2 * 3;
  print(y);
}
